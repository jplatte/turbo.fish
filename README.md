# turbo.fish

A website dedicated to the turbofish syntax from the [Rust Programming Language][], and its guardian angel, Anna Harren.

[In the comments of a Reddit thread][reddit], the name "turbofish" was coined for the first time by a developer named Anna Harren (u/deadstone),
and was used by both the community and official documentation.

Sadly, [she passed away in 2021][rust-1.55.0-dedication], but she will forever be memorialized within Rust.

A little joke website about a piece of syntax in the [Rust Programming Language][Rust Programming Language].

The name "turbofish" was made up by reddit user deadstone in 2015 ([reddit thread][reddit]), and has
since caught on in the Rust community, being used even in the [official documentation][docs].
