# turbo.fish

A website dedicated to the turbofish syntax from the [Rust Programming Language][], and its guardian angel, Anna Harren.

[In the comments of a Reddit thread][reddit], the name "turbofish" was coined for the first time by a developer named Anna Harren (u/deadstone),
and was subsequently used by both the community and [official documentation][docs].

Sadly, [she passed away in 2021][rust-1.55.0-dedication], but she will forever be memorialized within Rust.
