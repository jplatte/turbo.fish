            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3fimgp/comment/ctozkd0">In the comments of
                a Reddit thread</a>, the name "turbofish" was coined for the first time by a developer
            named Anna Harren (u/deadstone), and was subsequently used by both the community and
